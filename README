# 1 - Square root benchmarking
  - Measuring & comparing the performance and precision of multiple implementations of sqrt and rsqrt on x86

  C:
    - 64-bit precision (double)
    - 80-bit precision (long double)
    - 1000-bit precision (GMP)

  FORTRAN:
    - 64-bit precision (real)
    - 80-bit precision (long double)

NOTES: Suprisingly, FORTRAN is off compared to the C reference values.
